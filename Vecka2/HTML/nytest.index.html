        KTM 790 DUKE

The KTM 790 DUKE is devastatingly accurate. With the agility and purity you'd expect from a single, combined with the hard-hitting punch of a twin, the KTM 790 DUKE carves up the road with pinpoint precision. Boasting the all-new, compact 799cc LC8c parallel twin motor, nestled into one of the lightest frames around, the new KTM 790 DUKE is all about being fast everywhere, especially the corners. The delivery of the 105 hp (78 kW) and 87 Nm is efficiently controlled by advanced electronics and next-generation rider aids, making it impressively easy to race ahead of the pack.</div> </td>
